> if you’re doing this for a living, it might be worthwhile to take a step back and consider why you’re building this and how you should go about it. It’s easy to build a cool demo with foundation models. It’s hard to create a profitable product.

Critical or complementary

- AI reliability directly porportional to how critical it is to the application
  Reactive vs Proactive
- Reactive: AI is used to react to user input
  - Need to be fast and accurate most of the time
- Proactive: AI is used to proactively improve the application
  - Latency is not as critical
  - Can be seen as annoying
- Dynamic vs Static

AI product defensibility

- Need to be able to defend product moat
- If it's easy to replicate, it's not a moat
- In AI generally 3 types of competitive advantages: technology, data, and distribution

Setting expectations

- Choose good metrics
  - quality of responses
  - latency
  - cost

> the journey from 0 to 60 is easy, whereas progressing from 60 to 100 becomes exceedingly challenging.

Three Layers of the AI Stack

1. Application development

- providing a model with good prompts and necessary context
- requires good interfaces

2. Model development

- requires tooling like frameworks for modelling, trainign, finetuning, and inference optimization.
